## Introduction

So above picture shows how in a typical organization various people see a requirment. EveryOne has their own views and suggestions. But the Business decisions are made by management and due to this sometimes in future the organization regret of not selecting correct tools, strategies and plan. A new approach is to involve devs/devOps people in business decision. The reason behind this is their ability to see the requirement, making decision to select right resources, tools, timelines and many more in which they are expert.

  ### Typical Demand of Customers :

 - Increased and Improved deploy frequency which can lead to faster time to market.
 - Rate of failure becomes lower as deployment should be automated.
 - Shortened lead time.
 - Faster Recovery in case of Failures.


 ### Technical and Business benefits of including Devs and DevOps in Business Decision

 - A desired and required approach towards continuous software delivery.
 - Resolution to complex techical problems to fix on the spot.
 - Faster resolution of problems.
 - Faster delivery of features.
 - Suggestion of having correct tools and solution to supoort the business.
 - More stable operating environments as decision is made with cooperation. 
 - More time available to add value (rather than fix/maintain).
 - Lack in Communication gap in requirement analysis and requirement gathering.


### Lets understand it better by Example 

- Scenario 1 :
```
Lets take a scenario  where Mr. Mac is from Management and Mr. Dev is from Dev/Devops. After Requirement gathering in a business decision meeting, Mr. Mac identifies and finalizes few products and solution which will support their current Project. After purchasing the products and solution later they found problem with Environemnt compatibilty and capacity. Also they found if they could buy differnt product for supporting the project as resources in the project are already trained on this. Initially they spent lots of time and money to train people and then they started implementation and so on. 
```

- Scenario 2 :
```
Lets take another scenario  where Mr. Matt is from Management and Mr. Den is from Dev/Devops. In Requirement gathering  and in a business decision meeting, Mr. Matt and Mr. Den both identifies and finalizes few products and solution which will support their current Project. As Mr. Den already knew the capacity, requirement, skillset and approach to go ahead.After purchasing the products and solution later they found very smooth and streamlined operation of Project. Also they found they have reduced the cost and timeline to deliver the project. 
```

Scenario 2 looks more suitable as it  adds value to Organization in terms of time and money.


Therefore Its always good to include people from dev/devOps in business decision.
